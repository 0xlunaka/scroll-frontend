# Card Progression and Rarity System

The path to becoming a true Tsukibito requires mastery of both personal growth and the evolution of your Meme Senshi cards. This dual progression system ensures balanced advancement while maintaining the strategic depth of Lunaka's gameplay.

## Player and Card Level Progression

### Core Principles

**Separate XP Systems**: Players and cards have independent experience systems:
- **Player XP**: Earned from overall battles, challenges, and tournaments
- **Card XP**: Earned only when that specific card participates in battles

**Player Level as Cap**: Your player level defines the maximum level any Meme Senshi card can achieve
- Example: A Level 3 player can have cards at Levels 1, 2, or 3, but no higher

**Staking Mechanism**: Both players and cards require Luniko staking to unlock the next level once XP thresholds are reached

## Player Level Progression

| Player Level | XP Required | Luniko Required | Max Card Level | Unlocked Features |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | Basic battles and features |
| 2 | 500 XP | 200 Luniko | 2 | Tier 2 Meme Senshi cards |
| 3 | 1,500 XP | 500 Luniko | 3 | Tier 3 Meme Senshi cards |
| 4 | 3,000 XP | 1,000 Luniko | 4 | Advanced battle arenas |
| 5 | 5,000 XP | 2,000 Luniko | 5 | Advanced card abilities |
| 6 | 7,500 XP | 3,500 Luniko | 6 | Higher rarity cards |
| 7 | 10,500 XP | 5,000 Luniko | 7 | Advanced tournament features |
| 8 | 15,000 XP | 7,500 Luniko | 8 | Final rarity tiers |
| 9 | 20,000 XP | 10,000 Luniko | 9 | Max card power and legendary features |
