# Welcome to Lunaka

Welcome to **Lunaka**, a groundbreaking Turnchain-based card battle game that blends dynamic strategy, immersive lore, and vibrant anime-inspired visuals. Set on the mystical planet Lunaka, where life once thrived in harmony with the flow of Lunarium, players assume the role of Tsukibito (Keeper of Lunako) contenders.

## The World of Lunaka

Lunaka is a planet born from cosmic energies, where mysterious Primordial Meme Cores descended upon the forming world. These cores contained the spirits of legendary forces: the ever-loyal Dogecoin, the mischievous Pepe, the fierce Shiba Inu, and countless others.

Over millennia, as Lunarium—a luminous, liquid energy—began to circulate from Lunaka's heart to its surface and sky, these cores interacted with its flow. From this divine fusion, Lunaka's first intelligent beings emerged: the wise dogs, clever cats, nimble frogs, resilient goats, and industrious peanut squirrels.

## The Great Lunar Fracture

Centuries ago, the balance was disrupted by the greed of the Silver Dominion (銀領, Ginryo). They centralized control of Lunarium's flows, starving the surface and sky of their vital lifeblood. Their reckless tampering with the Lunaka Crystal shattered the flows of Lunarium, causing the energy to crystallize into solid Lunako.

This triggered the Lunaka Storm, a catastrophic surge that obliterated the Silver Dominion and fractured Lunaka into divided regions—the Great Lunar Fracture.

## The Gospel of Burokku

Amid the chaos, the ancient sage Satoshi Nakamoto awakened and revealed the Gospel of Burokku (ブロックの福音), a sacred philosophy teaching harmony through reconnecting Lunako to the flows. The Gospel declared that Lunaka's balance would only be restored when 50% of qualified Lunako was chained to the flows.
