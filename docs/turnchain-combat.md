# TurnChain Combat System

The heart of Lunaka lies in its revolutionary **TurnChain Combat System**, a dynamic battle mechanic where every action triggers a sequence of interactions between players. This creates thrilling, ever-changing battles that require adaptability, strategy, and mastery.

## How TurnChain Combat Works

### Chain Initiation
1. The attacking player selects one card to attack the opponent's current selected card
2. The defending player's card retaliates by attacking the attacker's next selected card
3. This creates the initial chain reaction

### Player Alternation
- Players take turns selecting cards to continue the chain
- Each selection alternates between attacks and responses
- Cards can be re-selected if their Lunarium Reserves (HP) remain above zero
- The chain continues until no valid interactions remain

### Card Removal Mechanic
- If a card's Lunarium Reserves (HP) drop to zero, it is **permanently removed** from the battle
- Removed cards cannot be selected again
- This creates high-stakes gameplay where every decision matters

### Abilities and Chain Dynamics
- Players can trigger abilities during their turn, shaping the chain's flow
- Active, Passive, and Chaotic abilities all interact with the chain system
- The chain ends when no valid interactions remain or when all cards on one side are defeated

## Card Stats and Abilities

### Core Stats
Every Meme Senshi card has three primary stats:

- **Lunar Force (LF)**: Determines attack power and offensive capabilities
- **Seal Aura (SA)**: Provides defensive strength and ability to withstand damage
- **Lunarium Reserves (HP)**: The card's health points - when this reaches zero, the card is removed

### Ability Types

#### Active Abilities
- Manually triggered during your turn
- Deliver devastating effects or enhance stats
- Have cooldown periods between uses
- Examples: "Lunar Bark", "Shadow Leap", "Speed Surge"

#### Passive Abilities
- Automatically triggered based on specific conditions
- Activate during attack, defense, or other game events
- Provide ongoing benefits or reactive effects
- Examples: "Loyal Vanguard", "Ripple Guard", "Nine Lives"

#### Chaotic Abilities
- Unpredictable effects that disrupt the chain
- Add an exciting layer of strategy and randomness
- Can completely change the course of battle
- Examples: "Moon Shot", "Chaos Leap", "Burning Will"

## Strategic Considerations

### Chain Management
- Think several moves ahead when selecting cards
- Consider how your choices will affect the opponent's options
- Balance offensive and defensive strategies

### Ability Timing
- Use active abilities at the most opportune moments
- Understand passive ability triggers to maximize their effectiveness
- Prepare for chaotic ability disruptions

### Resource Management
- Monitor your cards' Lunarium Reserves carefully
- Don't let valuable cards be removed unnecessarily
- Plan your chain to protect your strongest cards

## Advanced Tactics

### Chain Extension
- Keep the chain going as long as possible to maximize damage
- Use abilities that allow additional actions or turns
- Force opponents into unfavorable positions

### Defensive Positioning
- Use cards with high Seal Aura to absorb damage
- Position cards strategically to protect weaker allies
- Utilize defensive abilities to maintain card presence

### Offensive Coordination
- Chain attacks together for maximum impact
- Use abilities that enhance multiple cards
- Time your strongest attacks for maximum effectiveness

## Victory Conditions

A battle ends when:
- All cards on one side are defeated (Lunarium Reserves reach zero)
- No valid chain interactions remain
- A player concedes the match

The victorious warrior claims the entire Luniko offering of the battle, while the defeated loses their contribution.
